      "bio": "<p>Columbia Orchestra Member Since:  1978</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve always loved classical music (even at the age when normal kids were gaga over the Beatles and Rolling Stones).  I started playing the violin in the summer between third and fourth grade.  I\u2019ve played in orchestras ever since, all through junior and senior high school, college (Purdue), and since the first year of the Columbia Orchestra\u2019s existence.  Being able to touch the music first-hand gives me an increased appreciation of the music, and being enveloped by the music provides a thrill that cannot be realized by simply listening through speakers or (heaven forbid) earbuds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy all types of classical music, but my real joy is music of the 20th (and now 21st) Century, especially the Russians (Shostakovich, Schnittke), Americans (Corigliano, Rouse, Glass), and Scandinavians (Sibelius, Nielsen, Sallinen).  I also occasionally listen to so-called popular music (Joe Jackson, Pat Metheny, and yes, the Beatles), but I return to classical music because the complexity holds my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My day job involves way too many hours each week doing program management at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  When not working or playing/listening to music, I watch movies (Blood Simple, 12 Monkeys, Apocalypse Now, and more recently Up in the Air).  My wife (of 33 years) and I also like to hike (we just spent a long weekend at Shenandoah National Park) and watch TV (Modern Family, Better off Ted, The Good Wife).  In addition, as president of the Columbia Orchestra and Chairman of the Finance Committee, I spend time on orchestra-related administrative activities.  And every so often, we visit with our daughter Valerie, who is trying to succeed as a freelance cellist playing classical, popular, experimental music on the New York Scene.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Columbia Orchestra Member for Decades (can\u2019t remember when I started) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began with piano at some single digit age, but piano was never my main instrument.  I tried trumpet in 6th grade, but switched to trombone in 7th and dropped it junior year due to a school change (no instrumental music at the new school). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I trained for a career in Electrical Engineering at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut), and worked in that field and project management for just over 30 years, retiring early.  After about 7 years of retirement, I started a home improvement business which I still own and operate.  (I am really the only employee.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also trained as a pilot, holding a commercial license, with single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, and instrument ratings.  While I owned a small plane back then, I am inactive in that field now.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1970\u2019s, I joined the Columbia Concert Band playing trombone after a 22 year hiatus, then moved to a jazz big band course at UMBC, then joined the Columbia Big Band (CBB).  In the early 1980\u2019s I co-produced a Big Band jazz show at Ethel\u2019s Place (which featured renowned jazz singer Ethel Ennis), Ethel\u2019s Place being a new jazz club in Baltimore directly across the street from the Meyerhoff Theater.  Playing in that show was probably the greatest musical high of my life, certainly at that time, anyway.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I never really lost interest in piano though, and in the early 1980\u2019s received some piano lessons from Marc Cohen (now Marc Copeland), who is a pretty well known jazz pianist.  He had a remarkably different approach to teaching piano which I have never forgotten.  I would be happy to talk about it sometime.  After those lessons, I played much more piano than ever before, and I still play often, mostly just improv and mostly at home. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990\u2019s I joined the Columbia Jazz Band (CJB) (not to be confused with the Columbia Big Band (CBB)), but this time on bass guitar.  I had never played the bass guitar before, so I had to learn it really quickly.  At present, I am still in that position.  That band is currently under the direction of Pete Barrenbregge, former director of the Airmen of Note, the Air Force\u2019s premier jazz band.  In 2008, I toured Europe with the CJB, playing in the Montreux (Switzerland) Jazz Festival, and three other locations in Europe.  More Europe touring is in the works.  We have also played at Blues Alley, Washington, DC\u2019s top jazz supper club. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t remember when I joined the Columbia Orchestra, but I know it was in the previous century.  I play 2nd trombone there.  I have no training in classical music, so every season is a new adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also play in a trombone choir which is (usually) 12 trombones, playing under the direction of David Fetter, a former Principle Trombone in the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in the market for any home improvements, please check my ad in the Orchestra Programs.</p>",
