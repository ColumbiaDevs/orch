I have also played in the Baltimore Philharmonia Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra of Mt. Vernon Place, the UMBC Symphony, and the Johnstown (PA) Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who else in your family is a musicians?\r\nMy older brother plays viola in the New York Repertory Orchestra and my mother is the second clarinetist of the Johnstown (PA) Symphony Orchestra. My grandfather, Philip, was a composer and the dedicatee of Ralph Vaughan-Williams' Tuba Concerto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did you go to school and what did you study?\r\nMechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With whom have you studied?\r\nI currently study with Melina Gajger of the Peabody Conservatory. My previous teacher was Stanley Chepaitis of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Favorite Columbia Orchestra concert and why?\r\nSharing the stage with Mark O'Connor was unforgettable, because of the virtuosity and energy he brings to every performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are your favorite composers or pieces?\r\nLarge-scale pieces like the tone poems of Richard Strauss and the symphonies of Nielsen and Shostakovich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What\u2019s on your iPod?\r\nA lot of violin music, of course (who knew that Mendelssohn wrote *two* violin concerti?). Ever since reading \"The Rest is Noise\", I've been listening to more 20th-Century music, including composers like John Adams, Steve Reich, and Michael Torke. I also have a lot of progressive/\"symphonic\" rock left over from my college days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last book you read?\r\n_Physics of the Impossible_, by Michio Kaku</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Favorite TV shows?\r\n\"Good Eats\", \"Mythbusters\", and \"Ace of Cakes\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other surprising facts about you?\r\nI earned a private pilot's license (airplane, single-engine, land) in 2002.

This is a place where I can come make music with others, where we can become one unit as we work together to perform a particular piece of music. Through my own personal life journey the orchestra has been part of who I am. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue playing French Horn over the long haul. It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of these fine musicians. I am a graduate of Gettysburg College and Wesley Theological Seminary. On Monday nights, I belong to the orchestra, the rest of the time I am a Mom of two wonderful college age young women and a pastor at Taylorsville United Methodist Church. I am grateful to God for the gift of music, and as for me, I pray that all the music that I am a part of gives glory to God my Savior.</p>",

I have been with the orchestra since 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My musical experience started out as a second violinist in the Montgomery College Orchestra of Rockville. After hearing the sound of a solo viola at a wedding though I turned my attention to the  study that instrument in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with playing the orchestral repetoire for the viola I had my first theatrical experience playing in a production of OKLAHOMA. Working with singers and  the stage proved to be a valuable learning experience. I also had the opportunity to play some of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of my summers were spent in music camps that specialized in playing the chamber music of great composers from Haydn to Schubert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After years of playing these different genres of music, I have to say that playing the full orchestral works of the great compers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky is a source of great satisfaction and I am glad that the Columbia Orchestra makes this music available to our community.</p>",

I started playing the violin in the summer between third and fourth grade.  I\u2019ve played in orchestras ever since, all through junior and senior high school, college (Purdue), and since the first year of the Columbia Orchestra\u2019s existence.  Being able to touch the music first-hand gives me an increased appreciation of the music, and being enveloped by the music provides a thrill that cannot be realized by simply listening through speakers or (heaven forbid) earbuds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy all types of classical music, but my real joy is music of the 20th (and now 21st) Century, especially the Russians (Shostakovich, Schnittke), Americans (Corigliano, Rouse, Glass), and Scandinavians (Sibelius, Nielsen, Sallinen).  I also occasionally listen to so-called popular music (Joe Jackson, Pat Metheny, and yes, the Beatles), but I return to classical music because the complexity holds my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My day job involves way too many hours each week doing program management at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  When not working or playing/listening to music, I watch movies (Blood Simple, 12 Monkeys, Apocalypse Now, and more recently Up in the Air).  My wife (of 33 years) and I also like to hike (we just spent a long weekend at Shenandoah National Park) and watch TV (Modern Family, Better off Ted, The Good Wife).  In addition, as president of the Columbia Orchestra and Chairman of the Finance Committee, I spend time on orchestra-related administrative activities.  And every so often, we visit with our daughter Valerie, who is trying to succeed as a freelance cellist playing classical, popular, experimental music on the New York Scene.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Columbia Orchestra Member for Decades (can\u2019t remember when I started) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began with piano at some single digit age, but piano was never my main instrument.  I tried trumpet in 6th grade, but switched to trombone in 7th and dropped it junior year due to a school change (no instrumental music at the new school). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I trained for a career in Electrical Engineering at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut), and worked in that field and project management for just over 30 years, retiring early.  After about 7 years of retirement, I started a home improvement business which I still own and operate.  (I am really the only employee.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also trained as a pilot, holding a commercial license, with single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, and instrument ratings.  While I owned a small plane back then, I am inactive in that field now.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1970\u2019s, I joined the Columbia Concert Band playing trombone after a 22 year hiatus, then moved to a jazz big band course at UMBC, then joined the Columbia Big Band (CBB).  In the early 1980\u2019s I co-produced a Big Band jazz show at Ethel\u2019s Place (which featured renowned jazz singer Ethel Ennis), Ethel\u2019s Place being a new jazz club in Baltimore directly across the street from the Meyerhoff Theater.  Playing in that show was probably the greatest musical high of my life, certainly at that time, anyway.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I never really lost interest in piano though, and in the early 1980\u2019s received some piano lessons from Marc Cohen (now Marc Copeland), who is a pretty well known jazz pianist.  He had a remarkably different approach to teaching piano which I have never forgotten.  I would be happy to talk about it sometime.  After those lessons, I played much more piano than ever before, and I still play often, mostly just improv and mostly at home. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990\u2019s I joined the Columbia Jazz Band (CJB) (not to be confused with the Columbia Big Band (CBB)), but this time on bass guitar.  I had never played the bass guitar before, so I had to learn it really quickly.  At present, I am still in that position.  That band is currently under the direction of Pete Barrenbregge, former director of the Airmen of Note, the Air Force\u2019s premier jazz band.  In 2008, I toured Europe with the CJB, playing in the Montreux (Switzerland) Jazz Festival, and three other locations in Europe.  More Europe touring is in the works.  We have also played at Blues Alley, Washington, DC\u2019s top jazz supper club. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t remember when I joined the Columbia Orchestra, but I know it was in the previous century.  I play 2nd trombone there.  I have no training in classical music, so every season is a new adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also play in a trombone choir which is (usually) 12 trombones, playing under the direction of David Fetter, a former Principle Trombone in the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in the market for any home improvements, please check my ad in the Orchestra Programs.</p>",

Ok, that's not exactly true, I play the cello and it is by far my favorite instrument.  No offense to Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Act 3 Scene 2, I still love you oboe!  Must be something about the O's.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In elementary school, the music teacher came in and demonstrated all of the string instruments to the class. I heard the cello and went home to tell my parents I wanted to play that night.  This is from a person indecisive enough to take years before deciding to play baseball as a kid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've got Rostropovich's autograph stashed away somewhere, own the scores to Prokofiev 2, 4, 5, and 6, a rare English biography of Miaskovsky, and a book of Alfred Brendel's poetry.  My parents met singing Beethoven 9, and my dad once had lunch with Messaien.  (Though my grandfather once had a steak with Ted Williams.)  I like everything about music except Lalo and Yo-Yo, so it must again be something about the O's.  (But I still love you <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottorino_Respighi\">Ottorino</a>!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Clark Kent, I am a nerd.  My day job is writing websites, specifically <a href=\"http://www.pubmed.gov\">PubMed</a>.  In my spare time I revel in any hobby I can concoct, be that music, photography, cycling, or... other <a href=\"http://eddiewelker.com\">nerd things</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there is literally nothing else about me... time for music shout-outs! Big props to my old quartet (Peggy, Mollie & Ariel!), my cello friends (Kacy, Kristen), my music friends [yes, IN order!] (Andrea, Ashleigh, Cameo, Celia, Enoch, Jerome, Robin [the oldest], and Val [the newest]), my orchestras, GBYO & UMD, and Jason, my sisters, and... everyone else I missed and cause trouble with!</p>",
